# Bam Refactor API

As part of the Bam Refactor project, a new API is being created to help avoid
making direct database queries wherever possible, thus making most interactions
with the RAPTR database resistant to schema changes.

This site is intended to house the design documentation and API guidelines to
make both more accessible while this design is underway. The finalized API
documentation will be included in RAPTR's standard API documentation once it has
been solidified and implemented.

As this site is intended to aid in the design process, nothing herein should be
seen as set in stone. The guidelines and documentation are subject to change as
design decisions are finalized.
